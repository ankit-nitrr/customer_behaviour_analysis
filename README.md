Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL analysis, dashboard creation, and final reporting.
The goal is to extract actionable insights from raw data and present them clearly through visualizations and reports suitable for business stakeholders.
Dataset


Source: [Add dataset source or description here]


Format: CSV / Excel / Database table


Size: [Number of rows/columns]


Description:
The dataset contains structured data related to [briefly describe the domain, e.g., sales, customers, operations] and is used to analyze trends, patterns, and performance metrics.
